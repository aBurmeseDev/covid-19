# Care-Covid

### Intro
This is one of my side projects built in two days, with the purpose of keeping others informed with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases worldwide and resources.

The site features links to guidance and other resources for preventing exposures to, and infection with, the novel coronavirusâ€”officially named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
